## What is KitOps?

KitOps is a CNCF open standards project for packaging, versioning, and securely sharing AI/ML projects. Built on the OCI ([Open Container Initiative](https://opencontainers.org/)) standard, it integrates seamlessly with your existing AI/ML, software development, and DevOps tools.

It’s the preferred solution for packaging, versioning, and managing assets in security-conscious enterprises, governments, and cloud operators who need to self-host AI models and agents.

### KitOps and the CNCF

KitOps is a CNCF project, and is governed by the same organization and policies that manage Kubernetes, OpenTelemetry, and Prometheus. [This video provides an outline of KitOps in the CNCF](https://youtu.be/iK9mnU0prRU?feature=shared).

KitOps is also the reference implementation of the [CNCF's ModelPack specification](https://github.com/modelpack/model-spec) for a vendor-neutral AI/ML interchange format.

## KitOps Architecture

### ModelKit

KitOps packages your project into a [ModelKit](https://kitops.org/docs/modelkit/intro/) — a self-contained, immutable bundle that includes everything required to reproduce, test, or deploy your AI/ML model.

ModelKits can include code, model weights, datasets, prompts, experiment run results and hyperparameters, metadata, environment configurations, and more.

ModelKits are:
* Tamper-proof – Ensuring consistency and traceability
* Signable – Enabling trust and verification
* Compatible – Natively stored and retrieved in all major container registries

> *ModelKits elevate AI artifacts to first-class, governed assets — just like application code.*

### Kitfile
A [Kitfile](https://kitops.org/docs/kitfile/kf-overview/) defines your ModelKit. Written in YAML, it maps where each artifact lives and how it fits into the project.

### Kit CLI

The [Kit CLI](https://kitops.org/docs/cli/cli-reference/) not only enables you to create, manage, run, and deploy ModelKits -- it lets you pull only the pieces you need.

### 🎥 Watch KitOps in Action

[![KitOps Video](https://img.youtube.com/vi/j2qjHf2HzSQ/hqdefault.jpg)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j2qjHf2HzSQ)

This video shows how KitOps streamlines collaboration between data scientists, developers, and SREs using ModelKits.

## 🚀 Try KitOps in under 15 Minutes

1. **Install the CLI**: [for MacOS, Windows, and Linux](https://kitops.org/docs/cli/installation/).
2. **Pack your first ModelKit**: Learn how to pack, push, and pull using our [Getting Started](...) guide.
3. **Explore a Quick Start**: [Try pre-built ModelKits](https://jozu.ml/organization/jozu-quickstarts) for LLMs, CVs, and more.

For those who prefer to build from the source, follow [these steps](https://kitops.org/docs/cli/installation/#🛠️-install-from-source) to get the latest version from our repository.

## Key Benefits

KitOps was built to bring discipline to productizing AI/ML projects, with:
* 📦 Unified packaging and versioning of AI/ML assets
* 🔐 Secure, signed distribution
* 🛠️ Toolchain compatibility via OCI
* ⚙️ Production-ready for enterprise ML workflows
* 🚢 Create runnable containers for Kubernetes or docker
* 📈 Audit-ready lineage tracking

To get the most out of KitOps' ModelKits, use them with the **[Jozu Hub](https://jozu.com/)**. Jozu Hub can be installed behind your firewall and use your existing OCI registry in a private cloud, datacenter, or even in an air-gapped environment.

### Simplify Team Collaboration

ModelKits streamline handoffs between:
* Data scientists preparing and training models
* Application developers integrating models into services
* SREs deploying and maintaining models in production

This ensures reliable, repeatable workflows for both development and operations.

### Use KitOps to Speed Up and De-risk AI/ML Projects

KitOps supports packaging for a wide variety of models:
* Large language models
* Computer vision models
* Multi-modal models
* Predictive models
* Audio models
* etc...

> 🇪🇺 EU AI Act Compliance 🔒

> For our friends in the EU - ModelKits are the perfect way to create a library of model versions for EU AI Act compliance because they're tamper-proof, signable, and auditable.
