## What is KitOps?

KitOps is a CNCF open standards project for packaging, versioning, and securely sharing AI/ML projects. Built on the OCI (Open Container Initiative) standard, it integrates seamlessly with your existing AI/ML, software development, and DevOps tools.

It’s the preferred solution for packaging, versioning, and managing assets in security-conscious enterprises, governments, and cloud operators who need to self-host AI models and agents.

#### KitOps and the CNCF

KitOps is a CNCF project, so it's governed by the same organization and policies that manage Kubernetes, OpenTelemetry, and Prometheus. [This video provides an outline of KitOps in the CNCF](https://youtu.be/iK9mnU0prRU?feature=shared).

KitOps is also the reference implementation of the [CNCF's ModelPack specification for a vendor-neutral AI/ML interchange format](https://github.com/modelpack/model-spec).

## KitOps Architecture

### ModelKit

KitOps packages your project into a [ModelKit](https://kitops.org/docs/modelkit/intro/) — a self-contained, immutable bundle that includes everything required to reproduce, test, or deploy your AI/ML model. This includes code, model weights, datasets, metadata, environment configurations, and more.

ModelKits are:
* Tamper-proof – Ensuring consistency and traceability
* Signable – Enabling trust and verification
* Registry-native – Stored and retrieved like containers

> *ModelKits elevate AI artifacts to first-class, governed assets — just like application code.*

### Kitfile
A [Kitfile](https://kitops.org/docs/kitfile/kf-overview/) defines your ModelKit. Written in YAML, it maps where each artifact lives and how it fits into the project.

### Kit CLI

Finally, the [Kit CLI](https://kitops.org/docs/cli/cli-reference/) not only enables you to create, manage, run, and deploy ModelKits -- it lets you pull only the pieces you need.

### 🎥 Watch KitOps in Action

[![KitOps Video](https://img.youtube.com/vi/j2qjHf2HzSQ/hqdefault.jpg)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j2qjHf2HzSQ)

This video shows how KitOps streamlines collaboration between data scientists, developers, and SREs using ModelKits.

## Simplify Team Collaboration

ModelKits streamline handoffs between:
* Data scientists preparing and training models
* Application developers integrating models into services
* SREs deploying and maintaining models in production

This ensures reliable, repeatable workflows for both development and operations.

## Use KitOps to Speed Up and De-risk AI/ML Projects

KitOps supports packaging for a wide variety of models:
* Large language models
* Computer vision models
* Multi-modal models
* Predictive models
* Audio models
* etc...

> 🇪🇺 EU AI Act Compliance 🔒
>
> For our friends in the EU - ModelKits are the perfect way to create a library of model versions for EU AI Act compliance because they're tamper-proof, signable, and auditable.
