# Deploying KitOps ModelKits

This page outlines how to deploy models stored in KitOps ModelKits either:
1. To [Kubernetes or other shared container runtimes](#deploying-to-kubernetes-or-containers) (compatible with all model types)
1. To [run an LLM locally](#running-llms-locally) (using `kit dev`)

## Deploying to Kubernetes or Containers

The KitOps repo provides pre-built ModelKits that can be used for both semi-turnkey solutions, and more DIY options.

### Pre-built Containers

There are currently two pre-built containers:

1. Init container: https://github.com/kitops-ml/kitops/blob/main/build/dockerfiles/init/README.md
1. Kit CLI container: https://github.com/kitops-ml/kitops/blob/main/build/dockerfiles/README.md

### Init Container

The init container unpacks the model reference from a ModelKit to a specific path and then exits. This makes it useful as a Kubernetes `init` container. This container also supports verifying signatures for containers automatically from key-based or keyless signers.

The container is configurable via environment variables:

`$MODELKIT_REF`: The ModelKit to pull (required).
`$UNPACK_PATH`: Where to unpack the ModelKit (normally you’d want a `volumeMount` here). This is required and will default to `/home/user/modelkit`.
`$UNPACK_FILTER`: Optional filter to limit what is unpacked (e.g., just the model, or model + code). The filter format is the same as the [--filter command line argument](../cli/cli-reference/) for the Kit CLI.
`$COSIGN_KEY`: Path to the key that should be used for verification, mounted inside the init container (e.g., from a Kubernetes secret).
`$COSIGN_CERT_IDENTITY`: Signing identity for keyless signing.
`$COSIGN_CERT_OIDC_ISSUER`: OIDC issuer for keyless signer identity.

#### Example Kubernetes YAML

```
 apiVersion: v1
 kind: Pod
 metadata:
   name: my-modelkit-pod
 spec:
   containers:
     - name: model-server
       image: "" # Some container that expects your modelkit
       # Share a volumeMount between the init container and this one
       volumeMounts:
         - name: modelkit-storage
           mountPath: /my-modelkit

   # Run the init container to unpack the ModelKit into the volume mount and make
   # it available to the main container
   initContainers:
     - name: kitops-init
       image: ghcr.io/kitops-ml/kitops-init:latest
       env:
         - name: MODELKIT_REF
           value: "ghcr.io/kitops-ml/my-modelkit:latest"
         - name: UNPACK_PATH
           value: /tmp/my-modelkit
       volumeMounts:
         - name: modelkit-storage
           mountPath: /tmp/my-modelkit

   # Define a volume to store the ModelKit
   volumes:
     - name: modelkit-storage
       emptyDir: {}
```

### Using the Kit CLI Container

The containerized Kit CLI can be used to tailor the running of a ModelKit because you can run any Kit CLI command. This gives you flexibility, but more manual work (the world is your oyster, but it may be hard to shuck).

This container runs `kit` as its entrypoint, accepting Kit CLI arguments. So you could run the container instead of downloading and installing the Kit CLI, although you’ll need to mount a docker volume.

Docker run example:

`docker run ghcr.io/kitops-ml/kitops:latest pull jozu.ml/jozu/llama3-8b:8B-instruct-q5_0`

Kubernetes example:

```
 apiVersion: v1
 kind: Pod
 metadata:
   name: my-modelkit-pod
 spec:
   containers:
     - name: me-using-kit
       image: ghcr.io/kitops-ml/kitops:latest
       args: # You can put whatever you want; args is an array
         - pull
         - jozu.ml/jozu/llama3-8b:8B-instruct-q5_0
```

### Creating a Custom Container

Going a step further you can use the Kit CLI container to create your own bespoke ModelKit containers.

Example `dockerfile` for a custom container that has `my-modelkit` built into it:

```
 # Staged build to grab the ModelKit so we can use it later
 FROM ghcr.io/kitops-ml/kitops:latest AS modelkit-download

 # Download your ModelKit into the container
 RUN kit unpack my-modelkit /tmp/my-modelkit

 # Actual build stage; this just uses Alpine but you would build whatever
 # container you need here
 FROM alpine:latest

 # Normal container build + setup -- depends on your use case
 # ...
 # ...

 # Copy the downloaded ModelKit into this container
 COPY --from=modelkit-download /tmp/my-modelkit /home/user/modelkit-data
```

## Running LLMs Locally

If you're using Kit with LLMs you can quickly run the model locally to speed integration, testing, or experimentation.

::: tip
Kit dev currently only works with `GGUF` serialized models, if you'd like to expand its support for other types please create a [feature issue](https://github.com/kitops-ml/kitops/issues) and describe your planned approach.
:::

To run the ModelKit locally, first create a new directory for your LLM:

```sh
mkdir kitdev
cd kitdev
```

Now unpack an LLM ModelKit - there are several on [Jozu Hub](https://jozu.ml/discover), but here we're using Phi3 Mini because of its size:


```sh
kit unpack jozu.ml/jozu/phi3:3.8b-mini-instruct-4k-q4_K_M
```

Now start your LLM dev server locally using the [kit dev start command](../cli/cli-reference/#kit-dev-start):

```sh
kit dev start .
```

In the command output you'll see a URL you can use to interact with the LLM (there's a command flag to always use the same port). You can control parameters of the model, change the prompt, or chat with the LLM.

If you need to get logs use the [dev logs command](../cli/cli-reference/#kit-dev-logs):

```sh
kit dev logs
```

When you're done don't forget to stop the Kit dev server:

```sh
kit dev stop
```
