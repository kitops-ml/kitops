# Using KitOps ModelKits from a CI/CD Tool

To get the most out of KitOps secure ModelKits, many teams and organizations create, push, or pull ModelKits as part of their CI/CD pipelines. For example, when a team finishes tuning of a model, a pipeline will create a ModelKit that includes the model, the tuning dataset used, the artifacts generated by the successful experiment run, and the results of that experiment run. 

Typically this is done by installing the Kit CLI and running `kit` commands as tasks in the pipeline.

The KitOps community has shared some of their CI/CD tool integrations:
