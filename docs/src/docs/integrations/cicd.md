# Using KitOps ModelKits from a CI/CD Tool

To get the most out of KitOps secure ModelKits, many teams and organizations create, push, or pull ModelKits as part of their CI/CD pipelines. For example, when a team finishes tuning of a model, a pipeline will create a ModelKit that includes the model, the tuning dataset used, the artifacts generated by the successful experiment run, and the results of that experiment run.

Simply install the Kit CLI and run `kit` commands as tasks in the pipeline.

KitOps supports [all major CI/CD pipelines](./integrations.md#️-kitops-compatible-pipeline--storage-tools-a-z).

The KitOps community has shared some of their CI/CD tool integrations:
* GitHub Actions: [Tutorial](https://jozu.com/blog/automating-ml-pipeline-with-modelkits-github-actions/), and [Action](https://github.com/marketplace/actions/setup-kit-cli)
* Red Hat OpenShift Pipelines: [Tutorial](https://jozu.com/blog/how-to-turn-your-openshift-pipelines-into-an-mlops-pipeline)
* ArgoCD: [Tutorial](https://jozu.com/blog/deploying-ml-projects-with-argo-cd/)
