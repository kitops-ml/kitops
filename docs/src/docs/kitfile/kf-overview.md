# Kitfile Format for ModelKits

The **Kitfile** is the blueprint for every AI/ML project packaged with KitOps.

It‚Äôs a simple, YAML-based manifest that defines what goes into a ModelKit: models, datasets, notebooks, documentation, and metadata.

ModelKits use Kitfiles to package and version your project so it can be shared, stored, or deployed from any OCI-compatible registry.

## ‚ú® Why Use a Kitfile?

A Kitfile helps you:
- Package your AI/ML project with full traceability
- Make your work reproducible across environments
- Collaborate with DevOps, ML engineers, and app developers using a shared format
- Integrate seamlessly into CI/CD pipelines and registries

## üìö Kitfile Sections

Each Kitfile includes one or more of the following sections:

| Section       | Description |
|---------------|-------------|
| `package`     | Project metadata (name, version, license, authors) |
| `code`        | Paths to notebooks or scripts |
| `model`       | The serialized model and framework info |
| `datasets`    | Training, validation, or other datasets |
| `docs`        | Additional documentation to include |

You can extract the Kitfile from any existing ModelKit:

```sh
kit unpack [registry/repo:tag] --config -d .
```

## ‚úÖ Minimal Kitfile Example

The only required fields are:
- `manifestVersion`
- At least one of `code`, `model`, `datasets`, or `docs` section

Example:
```yaml
manifestVersion: v1.0.0

datasets:
  - name: training data
    path: ./data/train.csv
  - name: validation data
    path: ./data/test.csv
```

### Notes on Kitfile Behavior
- Kitfiles must use relative paths (not absolute)
- ModelKits can include only one model, but multiple datasets or code bases
- You can currently only build ModelKits from local files ‚Äî but support for remote sources (e.g. DVC, S3) is coming soon

## üß± Example: Full Kitfile

```yaml
manifestVersion: v1.0.0

package:
  authors:
    - Jozu
  description: Updated model to analyze flight trait and passenger satisfaction data
  license: Apache-2.0
  name: FlightSatML

code:
  - description: Jupyter notebook with model training code in Python
    path: ./notebooks

model:
  description: Flight satisfaction and trait analysis model using Scikit-learn
  framework: Scikit-learn
  license: Apache-2.0
  name: joblib Model
  path: ./models/scikit_class_model_v2.joblib
  version: 1.0.0

datasets:
  - name: training data
    description: Flight traits and traveller satisfaction training data (tabular)
    path: ./data/train.csv
  - name: validation data
    description: validation data (tabular)
    path: ./data/test.csv
```
