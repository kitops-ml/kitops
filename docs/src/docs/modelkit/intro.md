# ModelKit Overview

![ModelKit](./ModelKit_chart.svg)

>**ModelKit is a standardized, OCI-compliant packaging format for AI/ML projects.**  

It bundles everything your model needs — datasets, training code, config files, documentation, and the model itself — into a single shareable artifact.

Use ModelKits to version, share, and deploy AI models across teams and environments using familiar DevOps tools like DockerHub, GitHub Packages, or private registries.

## 🔑 Key Features

* **OCI-compliant and tool-friendly**  
  Store, tag, and version ModelKits in any container registry — no custom infrastructure needed.

* **Selective unpacking**  
  Unpack only the parts you need (e.g. just the dataset or model weights) to speed up pipelines and reduce compute overhead.

* **No duplication for shared assets**  
  Reuse datasets or configs across multiple kits without bloating storage.

* **Familiar versioning and tagging**  
  Use registry-native tags (e.g. `:latest`, `:prod`, `:rollback`) to track model state and history.

* **Built for ML workflows**  
  Supports AI-specific needs like serialized model handling, reproducible training snapshots, and data lineage.

* **Streamlined collaboration**  
  Teams can pull, inspect, and repack models just like container images — making it easier to collaborate across roles and environments.

## ⚡ Why It Matters

ModelKit simplifies the messy handoff between data scientists, engineers, and operations. It gives teams a common, versioned package that works across clouds, registries, and deployment setups — without reinventing storage or delivery.

It’s more than a format — it’s a building block for secure, reproducible AI.
