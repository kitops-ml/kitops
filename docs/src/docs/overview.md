# What is KitOps?

KitOps is an open-source tool that helps teams securely package, version, and deploy AI/ML models using familiar DevOps practices.

It‚Äôs built for data scientists, developers, and platform engineers working together on self-hosted AI/ML models ‚Äî and it makes sharing, automating, and deploying those models as simple as managing containerized apps.

Just like PDFs standardized document sharing, KitOps standardizes how AI/ML projects are packaged, shared, and deployed.

It‚Äôs a format your tools can understand, your teams can trust, and your pipelines can automate.

## Why Use KitOps?

AI/ML models involve more than just code ‚Äî datasets, configuration, documentation, and model weights all need to be versioned and delivered reliably. KitOps provides a standard, OCI-compliant way to package everything your model needs for development or production.

You can:
- Package models into deployable artifacts
- Share datasets and code securely between teams
- Automate packaging and deployment in CI/CD pipelines
- Run or test a model anywhere ‚Äî without fragile setup steps

## What‚Äôs Included

### üéÅ ModelKit: Standardized Model Packaging

The KitOps ModelKit is a packaging format that bundles all the artifacts of your AI/ML project ‚Äî including datasets, code, configs, documentation, and the model itself ‚Äî into an OCI-compliant Artifact.

This means ModelKits can be stored in your existing image registry, deployed to Kubernetes (or anywhere else containers run), and managed just like any container image.

See how to [deploy ModelKits](./deploy.md)

### üìÑ Kitfile: Config Made Easy

The Kitfile is a YAML configuration that describes what goes into a KitOps ModelKit. It‚Äôs designed for clarity and security ‚Äî making it easy to track what‚Äôs included, and to share AI/ML projects across environments and teams.

### üñ•Ô∏è Kit CLI: Create, Run, Automate

The Kit CLI is the command-line tool that ties everything together. Use it to:
- Create ModelKits from your local project
- Unpack and inspect existing kits
- Run models locally or in test environments
- Automate packaging in CI/CD pipelines

## Who Uses KitOps?

KitOps helps bridge the gap between experimentation and production for AI/ML workflows. Whether you‚Äôre running in the cloud, on-prem, or at the edge, KitOps makes it easier to collaborate across roles:

### For DevOps & Platform Engineers
- Use ModelKits in existing automation pipelines
- Store and manage models in your current container registry
- Build golden paths for secure AI/ML deployment

‚û°Ô∏è Integrate with [CI/CD](./integrations/cicd.md)

‚û°Ô∏è Add KitOps to [experiment trackers](./integrations/mlflow.md)

‚û°Ô∏è [Build a better golden path](../use-cases/) for AI/ML projects.

### For Data Scientists
- Package datasets and models without infrastructure hassle
- Share your work with developers without ‚Äúit works on my machine‚Äù issues
- Keep code and data versions aligned

üì∫ [See how to use KitOps with Jupyter Notebooks](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OQPp7QEvk7Q).

‚û°Ô∏è Use the [PyKitOps Python SDK in your notebooks](./pykitops/index.md)

### For Developers
- Use AI/ML models like any dependency ‚Äî no deep ML knowledge required
- Drop into apps using standard tools and APIs
- Let your team innovate without breaking your pipeline

## A Standards-Based Approach

The goal of KitOps is to become the open, vendor-neutral standard that simplifies and secures the packaging and versioning of AI/ML projects. In the same way that PDFs have helped people share documents, images, and diagrams between tools, KitOps makes it easy for teams to use the tools they prefer, but share the results safely and securely.

KitOps is governed by the CNCF and supported by contributors from across the AI and DevOps ecosystem.
